## About

Glitch Pic is a photo manipulation desktop app that allows users to easily transform any of their photos into glitch 
art. Users are able to specify the RGB values and direction or amount of the glitch effect they want applied to their 
photo, and they are able to step through the process and save their glitched result to their device. It provides users 
with a simple and easy way to make creative photos without having to use software like Photoshop.
